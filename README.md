This project is a simple HTML lab where I marked up a letter using proper structure and formatting. I set up the page with headings, addresses, lists, and inline tags like <abbr>, <time>, <sub>, and <sup> to follow the requirements. I also added links and a blockquote with a citation for the university motto. The provided CSS is included in the head to style the page. The final file is index.html, and it can be opened in any browser. It passes the W3C validator since it uses the right semantic elements.
